  Build a throwaway prototype to flesh out a design before committing to it.
  Routes between two branches — a runnable terminal app for state/business-logic questions,
  or several radically different UI variations toggleable from one route.
  Trigger: User wants to prototype, sanity-check a data model or state machine, mock up a UI, explore design options, or says "prototype this", "let me play with it", "try a few designs".

# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered — from the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → **Logic branch**. Build a tiny interactive terminal app that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper.
- **"What should this look like?"** → **UI branch**. Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts — getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** Locate the prototype code close to where it will actually be used (next to the module or page it's prototyping for) so context is obvious — but name it so a casual reader can see it's a prototype, not production. For throwaway UI routes, obey whatever routing convention the project already uses; don't invent a new top-level structure.
2. **One command to run.** Whatever the project's existing task runner supports. The user must be able to start it without thinking.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE — wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast and then delete it.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Delete or absorb when done.** When the prototype has answered its question, either delete it or fold the validated decision into the real code — don't leave it rotting in the repo.

## Logic branch

Build a minimal interactive app (terminal, CLI loop, or simple script) that lets the user:

- Push a state machine through transitions
- Feed edge-case inputs
- Observe the resulting state after each action

Use whatever language/framework the project already uses. The goal is to make abstract state relationships concrete.

## UI branch

Generate **at least three** radically different visual approaches to the same surface. All variations live on a single route, switchable via a URL parameter (e.g. `?variant=a|b|c`) and a floating bottom bar.

Each variant should explore a different design axis:

- **Variant A:** Minimal / information-dense
- **Variant B:** Visual / spacious / guided
- **Variant C:** Unconventional / experimental

Use the project's existing design tokens and routing conventions. Do not introduce new design system rules — this is exploration, not definition.

For scaffolding preview artifacts, use:

```bash
.skillgrid/scripts/preview.sh <change-id>-prototype
```

## When done

The _answer_ is the only thing worth keeping from a prototype. Capture it somewhere durable (commit message, ADR, issue, or a `NOTES.md` next to the prototype) along with the question it was answering. If the user is around, that capture is a quick conversation; if not, leave the placeholder so they (or you, on the next pass) can fill in the verdict before deleting the prototype.

## Return

- **Return:** the standard SDD envelope per `skills/_shared/sdd-return-envelope.md` (capture the validated answer and discarded alternatives in `detailed_report`).

## Integration with SDD

- If a prototype validates a design decision, promote it to the `sdd-design` or `sdd-ui-design` artifact.
- If a prototype reveals architectural friction (no clean seam for the validated behavior), flag it for `sdd-architecture-review`.
- Read `.skillgrid/project/CONTEXT.md` before starting to use correct domain terminology in the prototype.
