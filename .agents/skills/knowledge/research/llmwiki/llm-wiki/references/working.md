# LLM Wiki — Working with the Wiki

Load this when doing day-to-day wiki work (searching, bulk ingest, archiving, Obsidian sync) or reviewing pitfalls. The spine (activation, location, architecture, schema, core operations, lint) stays in SKILL.md.

## Searching

```bash
# Find pages by content
search_files "transformer" path="$WIKI" file_glob="*.md"

# Find pages by filename
search_files "*.md" target="files" path="$WIKI"

# Find pages by tag
search_files "tags:.*alignment" path="$WIKI" file_glob="*.md"

# Recent activity
read_file "$WIKI/log.md" offset=<last 20 lines>
```

## Bulk Ingest

When ingesting multiple sources at once, batch the updates:
1. Read all sources first
2. Identify all entities and concepts across all sources
3. Check existing pages for all of them (one search pass, not N)
4. Create/update pages in one pass (avoids redundant updates)
5. Update index.md once at the end
6. Write a single log entry covering the batch

## Archiving

When content is fully superseded or the domain scope changes:
1. Create `_archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move the page to `_archive/` with its original path (e.g., `_archive/entities/old-page.md`)
3. Remove from `index.md`
4. Update any pages that linked to it — replace wikilink with plain text + "(archived)"
5. Log the archive action

## Obsidian Integration

The wiki directory works as an Obsidian vault out of the box:
- `[[wikilinks]]` render as clickable links
- Graph View visualizes the knowledge network
- YAML frontmatter powers Dataview queries
- The `raw/assets/` folder holds images referenced via `![[image.png]]`

For best results:
- Set Obsidian's attachment folder to `raw/assets/`
- Enable "Wikilinks" in Obsidian settings (usually on by default)
- Install Dataview plugin for queries like `TABLE tags FROM "entities" WHERE contains(tags, "company")`

If using the Obsidian skill alongside this one, set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to the
same directory as the wiki path.

## Obsidian Headless (servers and headless machines)

On machines without a display, use `obsidian-headless` instead of the desktop app.
It syncs vaults via Obsidian Sync without a GUI — perfect for agents running on
servers that write to the wiki while Obsidian desktop reads it on another device.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Requires Node.js 22+
npm install -g obsidian-headless

# Login (requires Obsidian account with Sync subscription)
ob login --email <email> --password '<password>'

# Create a remote vault for the wiki
ob sync-create-remote --name "LLM Wiki"

# Connect the wiki directory to the vault
cd ~/wiki
ob sync-setup --vault "<vault-id>"

# Initial sync
ob sync

# Continuous sync (foreground — use systemd for background)
ob sync --continuous
```

**Continuous background sync via systemd:**
```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/obsidian-wiki-sync.service
[Unit]
Description=Obsidian LLM Wiki Sync
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/ob sync --continuous
WorkingDirectory=%h/wiki
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now obsidian-wiki-sync
# Enable linger so sync survives logout:
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

This lets the agent write to `~/wiki` on a server while you browse the same
vault in Obsidian on your laptop/phone — changes appear within seconds.

## Pitfalls

- **Never modify files in `raw/`** — sources are immutable. Corrections go in wiki pages.
- **Always orient first** — read SCHEMA + index + recent log before any operation in a new session.
  Skipping this causes duplicates and missed cross-references.
- **Always update index.md and log.md** — skipping this makes the wiki degrade. These are the
  navigational backbone.
- **Don't create pages for passing mentions** — follow the Page Thresholds in SCHEMA.md. A name
  appearing once in a footnote doesn't warrant an entity page.
- **Don't create pages without cross-references** — isolated pages are invisible. Every page must
  link to at least 2 other pages.
- **Frontmatter is required** — it enables search, filtering, and staleness detection.
- **Tags must come from the taxonomy** — freeform tags decay into noise. Add new tags to SCHEMA.md
  first, then use them.
- **Keep pages scannable** — a wiki page should be readable in 30 seconds. Split pages over
  200 lines. Move detailed analysis to dedicated deep-dive pages.
- **Ask before mass-updating** — if an ingest would touch 10+ existing pages, confirm
  the scope with the user first.
- **Rotate the log** — when log.md exceeds 500 entries, rename it `log-YYYY.md` and start fresh.
  The agent should check log size during lint.
- **Handle contradictions explicitly** — don't silently overwrite. Note both claims with dates,
  mark in frontmatter, flag for user review.

## Related Tools

[llm-wiki-compiler](https://github.com/atomicmemory/llm-wiki-compiler) is a Node.js CLI that
compiles sources into a concept wiki with the same Karpathy inspiration. It's Obsidian-compatible,
so users who want a scheduled/CLI-driven compile pipeline can point it at the same vault this
skill maintains. Trade-offs: it owns page generation (replaces the agent's judgment on page
creation) and is tuned for small corpora. Use this skill when you want agent-in-the-loop curation;
use llmwiki when you want batch compile of a source directory.
